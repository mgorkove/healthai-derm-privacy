Automating facial image anonymization for dermatological images

Created in January 2019 at the [Stanford Health AI hackathon](http://healthai.stanford.edu/events/2019-01-26-hackathon.html).

Background: HIPAA considers full face images identifiable Protected Health Information (PHI). Companies performing dermatological clinical trials can lose millions in the event of a data breach. Our solution automates facial image anonymization for dermatological images, making these images unrecognizable to even the most sophisticated facial recognition algorithms (Facebook, etc) and ensuring that patients' PHI is protected while preserving pathology.
